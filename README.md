# ML-project1
Heart-disease prediction model developed using the concepts of Machine Learning.Its a binary classification problem which predicts whether a person has a heart-disease or not.
Created a model using 6 step ML approch:
1. Problem Defination
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

Statement:
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
